//TODO's


//Immediate breaking changes

-None

//Things that need to be done but are not urgent

-Need to refactor out all the headers to be able to send them without having to specify it for every single method
-Need to add stores for items with lots of data to send to the server
-Need to refactor toggles to be rule based to work with changing rules.
-Need to change how menus work to be dynamically loaded
-Certain files have multiple classes in the same file, try and separate them out to be cleaner/easier to read
-Add security headers
-Need to add heartbeat/refresh of tokens
-Need to make node_modules one folder for both front-end and back-end so I only have to do npm install once.
